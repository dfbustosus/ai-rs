The old detective stood on the rain-slicked cobblestone street, the neon sign of "The Blue Dahlia" bar casting a lurid, flickering glow across his tired face. His trench coat was soaked, clinging to his shoulders like a second skin. He stared up at the single lit window on the third floor of the tenement building across the way, a lone silhouette moving behind the tattered curtains. A plume of smoke escaped his lips, mingling with the cold night air as a vintage car rumbled past, its headlights cutting through the dense fog.

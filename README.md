# AI-Powered Rust
Welcome to a curated collection of high-quality, production-grade projects that demonstrate the power and elegance of combining the Rust programming language with modern AI. This repository is more than just code; it is an exhibition of professional software engineering principles, from meticulous architectural design to robust, real-world application.

# The Projects
This repository contains three distinct, self-contained applications, each tackling a unique and challenging problem.

1. **The Command-Line Chatbot (ai-rs)**
demonstrates how to build a simple, robust, and interactive command-line chatbot. It serves as a perfect introduction to the core principles of building AI-driven applications in Rust.

**Core Competency**: Secure and reliable API interaction.

**Key Features:**

- Interactive chat session with conversation history.
- Secure API key management using a .env file.
- Fully containerized with a multi-stage Dockerfile for easy deployment.

A clean, modular architecture that separates concerns.

2. **AI-Powered Rust Code Analyzer (rust-analyzer-ai)**
This application uses an AI model to perform a "semantic review" of Rust code, acting as an experienced pair programmer to suggest meaningful, idiomatic improvements.

**Core Competency:** Semantic code analysis and developer tooling.

**Key Features:**

- Analyzes single files or entire project directories.
- Provides intelligent suggestions on code clarity, idiomatic expression, and anti-patterns.
- Demonstrates advanced Rust concepts, including source code parsing with syn.

A powerful example of using AI to augment the development workflow.

3. **The Explainable Sentiment Analysis Engine (sentiment-engine-rs)**
It is an example of Explainable AI (XAI) designed for applications where trust and auditability are paramount.

**Core Competency:** Explainable AI (XAI) and configuration-driven systems.

**Key Features:**

- Generates a "Chain of Thought" to justify each sentiment classification.
- Sentiment rules are defined in an external JSON file, making the engine highly adaptable.
- Implements a professional-grade tracing logging framework.
- Uses a robust, regex-based parsing strategy to handle AI responses reliably.
